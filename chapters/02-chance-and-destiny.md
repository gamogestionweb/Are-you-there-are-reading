# Chapter II
## Chance and Destiny
### Between the Illusion of Control and the Invisible Fabric

<p align="center">
  <em>"Two ways to look at life: meaningless accidents or a meticulously designed plan"</em>
</p>

---

There are two ways to look at life:

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center" width="50%">
<h3>Pure Randomness</h3>
<p>A series of meaningless accidents</p>
<p>Unconnected events</p>
<p>A game of probabilities</p>
</td>
<td align="center" width="50%">
<h3>Absolute Destiny</h3>
<p>A meticulously designed plan</p>
<p>Every decision predetermined</p>
<p>Free will is an illusion</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Between those two extreme positions, most of us exist—trying to find meaning in coincidences and fighting against the idea of a predetermined destiny.

## The Accident of Juan and Roberto

There are facts that challenge both ideas. Let's examine a hypothetical accident:

```
         JUAN'S TIMELINE                    ROBERTO'S TIMELINE
         ───────────────                    ──────────────────

    17:30  Boss asks to review document     17:30  Argument with partner

    17:45  Decides to have coffee           17:45  Leaves home distracted
           (+5 minutes delay)

    17:55  Impulse to walk instead          17:55  Mind elsewhere while driving
           of taking car

    18:00  Changes his usual route          18:00  Hesitates at traffic light
                                                   (left or straight?)

    18:05  ──────────────────── COLLISION ────────────────────
           Brakes, but tires unmaintained   Tries to maneuver, speed too high
           ↓                                ↓
           Skids more than expected         Cannot dodge

    18:04  Missed phone call that would
           have delayed him 30 seconds...
```

Every small detail, every minuscule variable, led to that precise instant when their lives collided.

## Chaos Theory

<table>
<tr>
<td width="100" align="center">
<h1>🦋</h1>
</td>
<td>

[Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) tells us that a minimal action can trigger disproportionate consequences.

The famous [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect): a butterfly's wings generating a hurricane on the other side of the world.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

It's the accumulation of small details that shapes reality, like domino pieces falling one after another without us being able to stop them.

> *We explore real cases of this phenomenon in [Chapter III: The Butterfly Effect](03-butterfly-effect.md)*

## The Problem of Perception

The problem is **we don't have access to that vision at the moment**.

We live trapped in our timeline, making decisions without knowing their repercussions.

```
    PAST                    PRESENT                   FUTURE
    ────                    ───────                   ──────

    ████████████████████████   ◉   ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

    We remember             We experience             We cannot see
    (with bias)             (limited view)            (only predict)
```

### What if we could see it?

Just as a machine interprets data and offers the most accurate possibility, wouldn't we be seeing the same fabric of reality?

> *We develop this idea from the perspective of artificial intelligence in [Chapter V: The Eternal Present](05-eternal-present.md)*
