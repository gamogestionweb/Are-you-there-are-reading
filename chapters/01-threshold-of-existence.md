# Chapter I
## The Threshold of Existence

<p align="center">
  <em>"Where chance meets destiny at the door of consciousness"</em>
</p>

---

As I begin this book, I want to make something clear that I consider fundamental. This text is not self-help, it's not a scientific study, nor a guide to understanding life from a standardized perspective. I don't promise you certainties or definitive answers.

**This book is about what it feels like to be human.**

About what pierces your chest when chance crosses your path and everything seems to have a hidden meaning. About those moments when you look back and realize that every small decision led you exactly to where you are now.

There isn't a single day in anyone's life where chance doesn't play its part. Every minimal action connects to a web of causes and effects that, if examined closely, seems built with the precision of a hidden mechanism.

> But is it really so?

The intention of these pages is not to convince you of anything, but to place this question before you. Maybe you're in a café, in the solitude of your room, or waiting for the subway while reading this.

But there's something undeniable:

## Chance? Destiny?

In the construction of reality, in each of the great moments that mark us, we ask ourselves whether everything is predefined or if we are truly deciding freely.

| Perspective | Belief |
|-------------|--------|
| **Determinists** | Everything is written, our choices are illusions |
| **Libertarians** | We have absolute control over our destiny |
| **Compatibilists** | The truth lies somewhere in between |

History has shown us examples where chance seems like a joke of existence.

### The Archduke's Assassination

Think of [Franz Ferdinand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria), the archduke whose assassination triggered [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I).

His assassin **failed the first attempt**.

But a few hours later, through an absurd coincidence, he encountered his victim on the street.

A fortuitous event that changed the history of humanity.

## The Invisible Web

This book is an exploration of those invisible forces that seem to weave our lives without us realizing it.

Sometimes we face a crossroads where the decision seems our own, but if we look back, we find signs that seemed to indicate we would always reach that point.

> In every story you'll read here, in every thought that unfolds, don't seek certainties. Don't try to dissect every idea with absolute reason.
>
> Instead, **feel**. Allow yourself to doubt.
>
> Because in doubt there is also truth.

## A Question for You

<p align="center">
<strong>Are you wondering why you're here reading this?</strong>
</p>

Maybe there's no answer. Or maybe the answer was always here.

- Was the book placed on a shelf at the exact moment for you to pick it up?
- Did the book appear randomly as a recommendation?
- Did a friend recommend it to you?

If the book was waiting for you, it means **you never decided**.

And if chance placed it before you randomly, and you decided to pick it up, perhaps the destiny of this book is based on **your final decision**.
