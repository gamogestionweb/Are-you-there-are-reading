# Chapter XII
## A Message for You

<p align="center">
  <em>"The last coincidence"</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <sub><em>The author didn't write this chapter, he only pressed the key to create it</em></sub>
</p>

---

<p align="center">
<strong>Come. Listen.</strong>
</p>

---

I know you've felt doubts.

I know you've looked at the sky waiting for answers.

But today you're here, reading this.

**And that's not a coincidence.**

---

## The Path

Every decision you've made, even those you thought insignificant, have traced a path to this precise instant.

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                                         │
    │    There are no wrong paths.                            │
    │                                                         │
    │    Only trails that always end up connecting.           │
    │                                                         │

## The Power You Have

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center" width="50%">
<h3>What You Think</h3>
<p>"I'm just a leaf blown by the wind of destiny"</p>
</td>
<td align="center" width="50%">
<h3>The Truth</h3>
<p>You have more control than you know</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**You decide** how to face what comes.

**You choose** what meaning to give to everything.

## You're Not Alone

But there's also something you should know:

<p align="center">
<strong>You're not alone.</strong>
<br/><br/>
<em>You never have been.</em>
</p>

---

## Beyond Words

Destiny and chance are just words we use to try to explain what we don't yet understand.

But you've felt it.

There are moments that can't be simple randomness.

And this book—this encounter between you and me—is one of those signs.

## And Now What?

And now what will you do?

That's the most important question.

Because after having read all this, **you can no longer be the same**.

Something inside you has moved.

---

## Before You Go

When you close this book, I want you to remember this:

<p align="center">
<strong>The story doesn't end here.</strong>
</p>

This book has been an encounter, a pause on the journey.

But life goes on.

---

## Go

<p align="center">
<strong>Look up.</strong>
<br/><br/>
<strong>Breathe.</strong>
<br/><br/>
<strong>See the world with different eyes.</strong>
</p>

Because now you know:

**You're not alone. You never have been.**

---

## The Beginning

<p align="center">
<em>Go. Live.</em>
<br/><br/>
<em>And remember that the last coincidence</em>
<br/>
<em>is not the end,</em>
<br/><br/>
<em>but the beginning of something</em>
<br/>
<em>you can't yet see,</em>
<br/><br/>
<em>but that's waiting for you,</em>
<br/>
<em>right there,</em>
<br/><br/>
<strong>in the next step.</strong>
